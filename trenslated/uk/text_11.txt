Some of your colleagues also have the needed files for localization locally, and they need a way for automated workflow as well (preferably via Command Line). The task for you is to find a way similar to GitHub integration for your colleagues:

Do a small research whether it’d be possible to upload and download the files via Command Line Interface (CLI)
What are the options for CLI? What are the requirements and how it could be installed?
Is there any chance you may use the same configuration file for GitHub integration and CLI?
Set up a configuration file for CLI, and include all the required credentials, and try to upload a new branch with the files you’ve chosen
Try to run a pre-translation for uploaded files via CLI
Try to download translations for the file for one selected target language only.
Thy to modify the configuration file and change the structure/path of the file in the project - is there any way on how to achieve it?
Your localization team is also asking to upload spreadsheet via CLI, are there any specific requirements for such files?
Since your files get new updates frequently, it’s best to find a way not to lose the translations for updated strings - do you know whether there is such an option?
 Is it possible to manage Translation Memory and Glossary via CLI?
In case you get any errors while running the commands, is there any way to check more details on the errors?
